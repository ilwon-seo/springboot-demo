### Spring-HATEOAS

> The Spring HATEOAS project is a library of APIs that we can use to easily create REST representations that follow the principle of HATEOAS (Hypertext as the Engine of Application State).
>
> Generally speaking, the principle implies that the API should guide the client through the application by returning relevant information about the next potential steps, along with each response.
